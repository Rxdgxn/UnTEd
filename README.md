**UnTEd** (Unconventional Text Editor) is a simple console based editor, mainly built for fun. It is planned to have syntax highlighting for several languages in the near future. Also, it is kind of an experiment to test out F#.  
**Warning:** this is just the bare minumum of a text editor, even more functionality will be added later on. *(hopefully)*

**Usage:** *dotnet run <filename>*  

**Controls:**  
> Ctrl + Z: turn on and off control mode. Use WASD to move your cursor (**typing won't work while in control mode**).  
> Ctrl + R: terminate the program (Ctrl + C can be used as well).
