**UnTEd** (Unconventional Text Editor) is a simple console based editor, mainly built for fun. It is kind of an experiment to test out F#.  
**Warning:** Incoming spaghetti code + tons of visual (and not only) bugs!

**Usage:** dotnet run *filename*  

**Controls:**  
> Ctrl + Z: turn on and off control mode. Use WASD to move your cursor (**typing won't work while in control mode**).  
> Ctrl + R: terminate the program (Ctrl + C can be used as well).
